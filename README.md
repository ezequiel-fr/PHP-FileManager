## Using *FileManager*

### Import files
To use **FileManager** into you PHP page, you will first need to import the `autoload.php` file like bellow.
```php
require __DIR__.'/FileManager/autoload.php';
```

### Using classes
The class you will use the most is `\FileManager\FileManager`.\
To use it you just have to create a new instance like that.
```php
// Using the class directly
$query = new \FileManager\FileManager();


// Using the namespace and class
use \FileManager\FileManager;

$query = new FileManager();
```

### And after ?
You have two simple options :
 - Use the functions of the `FileManager` class by intuition.
 - Read the [documentation](USAGE.md) about how to use the different functions.
